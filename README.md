Description of the API used and how it is implemented:

LadaMart uses the free FakeStore API to display mock product data, fetching items like electronics, clothing, and accessories with details such as prices, descriptions, and ratings. The JavaScript code dynamically generates product cards from this data and allows sorting by price or name, while localStorage saves users' carts and wishlists between visits. Though this API is great for development (no authentication needed, fast responses), it's read-only, meaning real purchases aren't possible, so a future upgrade to a custom backend would be needed for actual transactions. This setup lets LadaMart simulate a real e-commerce experience while focusing on frontend design and user interactions.
